						Who I am

					</h3>

					<p class="skillBody">
						
						"Game. Cook. Eat!" If you say it fast enough it sounds like "game-cookie." It's a motto I apply in life to many things. Sometimes it's literal gaming via characters like Mario while others I'm hunting some tasty game to turn into a marvelous meal. Cooking food has always been a passion of mine. The more I learn about the development process for games and websites the more similarities I find between the two. Eating and experiencing new foods, media, and adventures is something I find to be one of life's greatest rewards. I'm a creator at heart be it games, websites, taxidermy art, or giant pieces of smoke meat. I love creating in a space with limitations. My years spent in the taxidermy industry lent me problem solving of an often creative nature. Customizing mounts to fit into very specific spaces or themes provided by a client was never dull. Transitioning from that industry into the gaming and web development fields have provided many new challenges but more importantly opportunity to learn a new set of skills. I still find often very specific spaces and themes which need to be met for clients. I'm always looking to improve and learn from previous attempts. Nothing illustrates this more than smoking meat. Taking a large pieces of meat, usually undesirable due to toughness, and transforming them into a unique mouth watering meal is some of the most rewarding work I do. No matter how good it is there's always something to take away and improve on.

						What I'm currently working on

					</h3>

					<p class="skillBody">
						
						Currently I'm working to become a full stack web developer via online tutorials. HTML, CSS5, Javascript, etc. paired with all things backend. My education in game design paired with my design experience as a taxidermist has created a solid foundation for things like layout, color schemes, and the like. I'm also working on a few games in my spare time that are passion projects. Finally as always, smoking my next giant piece of meat is never far from the horizon.
